    "* Predictive Machine Learning\n",
    "* Machine Learning Model Training and Tuning\n",

    "\n",
    "**YouTube Lecture**: check out my lecture on [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/zOUM_AnI1DQ?si=Gi2KZTfPa5xQ2Qb6). For your convenience here's a summary of salient points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation for Machine Learning Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "You could just open up a Jupyter notebook in Python and start building machine learning models. \n",
    "\n",
    "* the [scikit-learn docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) are quite good and for every machine learning function there is a short code example that you could copy and paste to repeat their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "* also, you could Google a question about using a specific machine learning algorithm in Python and the top results will include [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) questions and responses, it is truly amazing how much experienced coders are willing to give back and share their knowledge. We truly have an amazing scientific community with the spirit of knowledge sharing and open-source development. Respect.\n",
    "\n",
    "* of course, you could learn a lot about machine learning from a machine learning large language model (LLM) like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/). Not only will ChatGPT answer your questions, but it will also provide codes and help you debug them when you tell it what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of the other and you received and added this code to you data science workflow,\n",
    "\n",
    "````python\n",
    "n_neighbours = 10; weights = \"distance\"; p = 2\n",
    "neigh = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=n_neighbours,weights = weights,p = p).fit(X_train,y_train) \n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "et voil√† (note I'm Canadian, so I use some French phrases), you have a trained predictive machine learning model that could be applied to make predictions for new cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "* But, is this a good model?\n",
    "* How good is it?\n",
    "* Could it be better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without knowledge about basic machine learning concepts we can't answer these questions and build the best possible models. In general, I'm not an advocate for black box modeling, because it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. likely to lead to mistakes that may be difficult to detect and correct\n",
    "\n",
    "2. incompatible with the expectations for competent practice for professional engineers. I gave a talk on [Applying Machine Learning as a Compentent Engineer or Geoscientist](https://youtu.be/W_ZDg1Wb2vM?si=DF-n1E4-ik2ukLfF)\n",
    "\n",
    "To help out this chapter provides you with the basic knowledge to answer these questions and to make better, more reliable machine learning models. Let's start building this essential foundation with some definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone hears that machine learning needs a lot of data. In fact, so much data that it is called \"big data\", but how do you know if you are working with big data? \n",
    "\n",
    "* the criteria for big data are these 'V's\n",
    "\n",
    "If you answer \"yes\" for at least some of these criteria, then you are working with big data,\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Volume**: many data samples, difficult to handle and visualize\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Velocity**: high rate collection, continuous relative to decision making cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variety**: data form various sources, with various types and scales\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variability**: data acquisition changes during the project\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Veracity**: data has various levels of accuracy \n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, most subsurface engineers and geoscientists answer \"yes\" to all of these 'v' criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "* so I proudly say that we in the subsurface have been big data long before the tech sector learned about big data\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, I often state that we in the subsurface resource industries are the original data scientists. \n",
    "\n",
    "* I'm getting ahead of myself, more on this in a bit. Don't worry if I get carried away in hubris, rest assured this e-book is written for anyone interested to learn about machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* you can skip the short sections on subsurface data science or read along if interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know big data, let's talk about the big data related topics, statistics, geostatistics and data analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistics, Geostatistics and Data Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is the practice of,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. collecting data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. organizing data\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. interpreting data\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. drawing conclusions from data\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. making decisions with data\n",
    "\n",
    "It is all about moving from data to decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} The importance of decision making in statistics.\n",
    ":class: remove-from-content-only\n",
    "\n",
    "If your work does not impact the decision, you do not add value!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look up the definition of data analytics, you will find criteria that include, statistical analysis, and data visualization to support decision making. \n",
    "\n",
    "* I call it, data analytics and statistics are the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can append, geostatistics as a branch of applied statistics that accounts for, \n",
    "\n",
    "1. the spatial (geological) context\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. the spatial relationships \n",
    "\n",
    "3. volumetric support\n",
    "\n",
    "4. uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember all those statistics classes with the assumption of i.i.d., independent, identically distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "* spatial phenomenon are not i.i.d., so we developed a unique branch of statistics to address this\n",
    "\n",
    "* by our assumption above (statistics is data analytics), we can state that geostatistics is the same as spatial data analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's use a Venn diagram to visualize statistics / data analytics and geostatistics / spatial data analytics,\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",

    "Shortly after Kolmogorov developed the fundamental probability axioms, Danie Krige developed a set of statistical, spatial, i.e., data-driven tools for making estimates in space while accounting for spatial continuity and scale. These tools were formalized with theory developed by Professor Matheron during the 1960s in a new science called geostatistics. Over the 1970s - 1990s the geostatistical methods and applications expanded from mining to address oil and gas, environmental, agriculture, fisheries, etc. with many important open source developments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why was subsurface engineering and geoscience earlier in the development of data science? \n",
    "\n",
    "* because, necessity is the mother of invention! Complicated, heterogeneous, sparsely sampled, vast systems with complicated physics and high value decisions drove us to data-driven methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other engineering fields that had little motivation to develop and apply data science due to,\n",
    "\n",
    "* homogeneous phenomenon that does not have significant spatial heterogeneity, continuity, nor uncertainty - with few samples the phenomenon is sufficiently understood, for example, sheet aluminum used for aircraft or cement used in structures\n",
    "  \n",
    "* exhaustive sampling of the population relative to the modeling purpose and do not need an estimation model with uncertainty - the phenomenon's properties are known and the performance can be simulated in a finite element model, for example, radiographic testing for cracks in a machine housing\n",
    "  \n",
    "* have well understood physics and can model the entire system with second and third paradigm phenomenon - the (coupled) physics is known and can be modeled, for example, the Boeing 777 was the first commerical airliner designed entirely using computed-aided design (CAD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare this to the typical context of subsurface engineering and geoscience, where data challenges are both unique and substantial:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sparsely sampled datasets** ‚Äì we often sample only a minuscule fraction‚Äîsometimes as little as one hundred-billionth‚Äîof the subsurface volume of interest. This leads to significant uncertainty and a heavy reliance on statistical and data-driven models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Massively multivariate datasets** ‚Äì integrating diverse data types (e.g., seismic, well logs, core data) poses a major challenge, requiring robust multivariate statistical and machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complex, heterogeneous earth systems** ‚Äì subsurface geology is highly variable and location-dependent. These open systems often behave unpredictably, demanding flexible and adaptive modeling approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **High-stakes, high-cost decisions** ‚Äì The need to support critical, high-value decisions drives innovation in methods, workflows, and the adoption of advanced analytics.\n",

    "#### Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to define machine learning, a [Wikipedia artical on Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) can be summarized and broken down as follows, machine learning has these aspects,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **toolbox** - a collections of algorithms and mathematical models used by computer systems\n",
    "   \n",

    "   \n",
    "3. **training data** - by learning patterns from sample data\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **general** - to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for the specific task\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs highlight some key ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* machine learning is a numerical toolbox, a broad set of algorithms designed to adapt to different problems (toolbox)\n",
    "\n",
    "* these algorithms improve by learning from or fitting to training data (learning from training data)\n",
    "\n",
    "* a single algorithm can often be trained and applied across many different domains (generalization)\n",

    "Where it is infeasible to develop an algorithm of specific instructions for performing the task\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This underscores that machine learning is most valuable when traditional rule-based programming becomes too complex, impractical, or infeasible, often due to the scale or variability of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if the underlying theory is well understood, be it engineering principles, geoscience fundamentals, physics, chemical reactions, or mechanical systems, then use that knowledge first. \n",
    "\n",
    "* don‚Äôt rely on data science as a replacement for foundational understanding of science and engineering (Paraphrased from personal communication with Professor Carlos Torres-Verdin, 2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine Learning Prerequisite Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand machine learning and in general, data science we need to first differentiate between the population and the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Population\n",
    "\n",
    "The population is all possible information of our spatial phenomenon of interest. Exhaustive, finite list of feature of interest over area of interest at the resolution of the data. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* exhaustive set of porosity at every location within a gas reservoir at the scale of a core sample, i.e., imagine the entire reservoir drilled, extracted and analyzed core by core! \n",
    "\n",
    "* for every tree in a forest the species, diameter at breast height (DBH), crown diameter, age, tree health status, wood volume and location, i.e., perfectly knowledge of our forest!\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally the entire population is not accessible due to,\n",
    "\n",
    "* technology limits - sampling methods that provide improved coverage generally have reduced resolution and accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "* practicallity - removing too much reservoir will impact geomechanical stability\n",
    "\n",
    "* cost - wells cost 10s - 100s of millions of dollars each\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "The limited set of values, at specific locations that have been measured. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "* limited set of porosity values measured from extracted core sample and callibrated from well-logs within a reservoir\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1,000 randomly selected trees over an management unit, with species, diameter at breast height (DBH), crown diameter, age, tree health status, wood volume and location\n",
    "\n",
    "There is so much that I could mention about sampling! For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* methods for representative sample selection\n",
    "\n",
    "* impact of sample frequency or coverage on uncertainty and required levels of sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "* methods to debias biased spatial samples (see [Declustering to Debias Data](https://geostatsguy.github.io/GeostatsPyDemos_Book/GeostatsPy_declustering.html) from my [Applied Geostatistics in Python e-book](https://geostatsguy.github.io/GeostatsPyDemos_Book/intro.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "For brevity I will not cover these topics here, but let's now dive into, \n",
    "\n",
    "* What are we measuring from our population in our samples?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each distinct type of measure is called a variable or feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Variable or Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "In any scientific or engineering study, a property that is measured or observed is typically referred to as a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "* however, in data science and machine learning, we use the term feature almost exclusively.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the terminology differs, the concept is the same: both refer to quantitative or categorical information about an object or system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate what constitutes a feature, consider the following examples drawn from real-world geoscience, oil adn gas, and mining contexts,\n",
    "\n",
    "* porosity measured from 1.5 inch diameter, 2 inch long core plugs extracted from the Miocene-aged Tahiti field in the Gulf of Mexico\n",
    "\n",
    "* permeability modeled from porosity (neutron density well log) and rock facies (interpreted fraction of shale logs) at 0.5 foot resolution along the well bore in the Late Devonian Leduc formation in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.\n",
    "\n",
    "* blast hole cuttings nickel grade aggregated over 8 inch diameter 10 meter blast holes at Voisey‚Äôs Bay Mine, Proterozoic gneissic complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "Did you see what I did? \n",
    "\n",
    "* I specified what was measured, how it was measured, and over what scale was it measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important because,\n",
    "\n",
    "* **how the measurement is made?** - changes the feature's veracity (level of certainty in the measure) and different methods actually may change the shift the feature's values so we may need to reconcile multiple measurement methods of the same feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **what is the scale of the measurement?** - is very important due to volume-variance effect, with increasing support volume, sample scale, the variance reduces due to volumetric averaging resulting in regression to the mean. I have a [chapter on volume-variance](https://geostatsguy.github.io/GeostatsPyDemos_Book/GeostatsPy_volume_variance.html) in my Applied Geostatistics in Python e-book for those interested in more details. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, our subsurface measurements often requires significant analysis, interpretation, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "* we don't just hold a tool up to the rock and get the number\n",
    "\n",
    "* we have a \"thick layer\" of engineering and geoscience interpretation to map from measurement to a useable feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this carbonate thin section from Bureau of Economic Geology, The University of Texas at Austin from [geoscience course](http://www.beg.utexas.edu/lmod/_IOL-CM07/old-4.29.03/cm07-step05.htm) by F. Jerry Lucia.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Note: the blue dye in core samples visually indicates void space‚Äîthe pores in the rock. But is the porosity feature simply the blue area divided by the total area of the sample?\n",
    "\n",
    "* that would give us total porosity, which is the ratio of total void volume to bulk volume\n",
    "\n",
    "* however, not all pore space contributes to fluid flow. Some pores are isolated or poorly connected, especially in low-permeability rocks\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the porosity that actually matters for flow, we need to interpret connectivity. This gives us effective porosity, a more useful feature for modeling fluid transport, permeability, and reservoir performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* so even porosity, often seen as a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù feature that‚Äôs observable in well logs and suitable for linear averaging, doesn‚Äôt escape an essential interpretation step. Estimating effective porosity involves assumptions, thresholds, or models about pore geometry and connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a critical reminder, our features generally require interpretation, even when they appear directly measurable. Measurement scale, observation method, and intended use all influence how we define and derive a useful feature for our data science models.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Predictor and Response Features\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the difference between predictor and response features let's look at the most concise expression of a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* the predictors (or independent) features (or variables) the model inputs, i.e., the $X_1,\\ldots,X_m$\n",
    "\n",
    "* response (or dependent) feature(s) (or variable(s)) are the model output, $y$,\n",
    "\n",
    "and there is an error term, $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is all about estimating such models, $\\hat{ùëì}$, for two purposes, inference or prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Inference \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can make reliable predictions, we must first perform inference‚Äîthat is, we must learn about the underlying system from a limited sample in order to model the broader population. Inference is the process of building an understanding of the system, denoted as $\\hat{f}$, based on observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through inference, we seek to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the relationships between features?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which features are most important?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are there complicated or nonlinear interactions between features?\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights are prerequisites for making any predictions, because they form the foundation of the model that will eventually be used for forecasting, classification, or decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine I walk into a room, pull a coin from my pocket, and flip it 10 times, observing 3 heads and 7 tails. Then I ask, ‚ÄúIs this a fair coin?‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic inferential problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* you‚Äôre using a limited sample (the 10 flips) to make an inference about the population‚Äîin this case, the probability distribution governing the coin\n",
    "\n",
    "* and here‚Äôs the key twist: in this example, the coin itself is the population!\n",
    "\n",
    "You're not just summarizing the sample, you're trying to learn something general about the system that generated the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we‚Äôve completed inference‚Äîlearning from a sample to build a model of the underlying population‚Äîwe‚Äôre ready to use that model for prediction. Prediction is the process of applying what we‚Äôve learned to estimate the outcomes of new or future observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* in short, inference goes from sample to the population, while prediction goes from population model to the new sample\n",
    "\n",
    "* the goal of prediction is to produce the most accurate estimates of unknown or future outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs return to our earlier coin example,\n",
    "\n",
    "* you observe me flip a coin 10 times and see 3 heads and 7 tails. Based on this, you infer that the coin is likely biased toward tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, before I flip it again, you predict that the next 10 tosses will likely result in more tails than heads. That‚Äôs prediction, using your inferred model of the coin (i.e., the population) to estimate future data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Inference vs. Prediction in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do you know whether you're doing inference or prediction in the machine learning context? \n",
    "\n",
    "* it depends on whether you're modeling structure or estimating outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inferential Machine Learning**, also called unsupervised learning, involves only predictor features (no known outcomes or labels). The aim is to learn structure in the data and improve understanding of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of machine learning inferential methods include,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cluster analysis ‚Äì groups observations into distinct clusters (potential sub-populations), often as a preprocessing step for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dimensionality reduction ‚Äì reduces the number of features by finding combinations that best preserve information while minimizing noise, for example, princpal components analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) or multidimensional scaling (MDS).\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques help reveal relationships, patterns, or latent variables in the data‚Äîcrucial for good modeling, but are not designed to make direct predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some may push back on my definition of inferential machine learning and the inclusion of cluster analysis, because they include in statistical inference quantification of uncertainty and testing hypotheses that is not available in cluster analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I defend my choice by the difficulty and importance of identifying groups in subsurface and spatial datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For example, depofacies for reservoir models commonly describe 80% of heterogeneity, i.e., the deposfacies are the most important inference for many reservoirs!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also, I have a very broad view of uncertainty modeling and model checking that includes various types of resampling, for example, bootstrap and spatial boostrap and in the subsurface we can only rarely use analytical confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predictive Machine Learning**, also called supervised learning, this involves both predictor features and response features (labels). The model is trained to predict the response for new samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of machine learning predictive methods include,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear regression - estimating the response feature as a linear combination of the predictor features\n",
    "\n",
    "* Naive Bayes classifier - estimating the probability of each possible categorical result for a response feature from the product sum of the prior probability and each likelihood conditional probability \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is optimized to minimize prediction error, often evaluated through cross-validation or test data. Let's talk about how to make predictive machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training and Tuning Predictive Machine Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In predictive machine learning, we follow a standard model training and testing workflow. This process ensures that our model generalizes well to new data, rather than just fitting the training data perfectly.\n",

    "* typically, 15%‚Äì30% of the data is held out for testing\n",
    "\n",
    "* the remaining 70%‚Äì85% is used for training the model\n",

    "2. **Define a range of hyperparameter(s)** values to explore, ranging from,\n",
    "\n",
    "* simple models with low flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "* to complex models with high flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ This step may involve tuning multiple hyperparameters, in which case efficient sampling methods (e.g., grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization) are often used.\n",
    "\n",

    "* **What is the main outcome of steps 1‚Äì5?** - the only reliable outcome is the tuned hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ we do not use the model trained in step 3 or 4 directly, because it was trained without access to all available data. Instead, we retrain the final model using all data with the selected hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why not train the model on all the data from the beginning?** - because if we do that, we have no independent way to evaluate the model's generalization. A very complex model can easily overfit‚Äîfitting the training data perfectly, but performing poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ overfitting happens when model flexibility is too high‚Äîit captures noise instead of the underlying pattern. Without a withheld test set, we can‚Äôt detect this.\n",

    "This workflow for training and tuning predictive machine learning models is,\n",
    "\n",
    "* an empirical, cross-validation-based process\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Model Variance** - is error due to sensitivity to the dataset, for example a simple model like linear regression does not change much if we change the training data, but a more complicated model like a fifth order polynomial model will jump around a lot as we change the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ More model complexity tends to increase model variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Bias** -  is error due to using an approximate model, i.e., the model is too simple to fit the natural phenomenon. A very simple model is inflexible and will generally have higher model bias while a more complicated model is flexible enough to fit the data and will have lower model bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ More model complexity tends to descrease model bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Irreducible Error** - is due to missing and incomplete data. There may be important features that were not sampled, or ranges of feature values that were not sampled. This is the error due to data limitations that cannot be address by the machine learning model hyperparameter tuning for optimum complexity; therefore, irreducible error is constant over the range of model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ More model complexity should not change irreducible error.\n",

    "Now, let's get into more details about under and overfit machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Underfit and Overfit Models\n",
    "\n",
    "First visualize underfit and overfit first with a simple prediction problem with one predictor feature and one response feature, here's a model that is too simple (left) and a model that is too complicated (right).\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some observations,\n",
    "\n",
    "* the simple model is not sufficiently flexible to fit the data, this is likely an underfit model\n",
    "\n",
    "* the overfit model perfectly fits all of the training data but is too noisy away from the training data and is likely an overfit model\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the difference, we can now plot the training error alongside the previously shown testing error curve, illustrating how both change with model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"_static/concepts/overfit.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 60%;\">\n",
    "  <figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Model error in training and testing vs. model complexity with illustration of under- and overfit model regions.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "From the plot, we can make the following observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training Error** ‚Äì as model complexity increases, training error consistently decreases. With sufficient flexibility, the model can eventually fit the training data perfectly, driving training error to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Testing Error** ‚Äì testing error is composed of bias, variance, and irreducible error. The interplay between bias and variance leads to a trade-off, resulting in an optimal model complexity that minimizes testing error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these observations, we can characterize underfitting and overfitting as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Underfitting** - occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Such models fail to generalize well and tend to show high training and testing errors. As complexity increases, testing error decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overfitting** - occurs when a model is too complex and captures not only the underlying data patterns but also the noise. While training error continues to decrease, testing error starts to increase due to poor generalization. These models can give a false impression of strong performance, misleading us into thinking we understand the system better than we do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More About Training and Testing Splits\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical part of the machine learning training and tuning workflow is the training and testing data split. Here is some more considerations about training and testing data splits,\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Proportion Withheld for Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta studies have identified that between 15% and 30% withheld for testing is typically optimum. To understand the underlying trade-off imagine these end members,\n",
    "\n",
    "* withhold 2% of the data for testing, then we will have a lot of training data to train the model very well, but too few testing data to test our model over a range of prediction cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* withhold 98% of the data for test, then with only 2% of the data available for training we will do a very good job testing our very poor model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportion to withhold for testing is a trade off between building a good model and testing this model well with a wide range of prediction cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Other Cross Validation Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The train and test workflow above known as a cross validation or hold out approach, but there are many other methods for model training and testing,\n",
    "\n",
    "* **k-fold Cross Validation (K-fold CV)** - we divide the data into k mutually exclusive, exhaustive equal size sets (called folds) for repeat the model train and test k times with each fold having a turn being withheld testing data while the remainder is training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOO CV)** - we loop over all data, each time we assign the one datum as the testing data and train on the remainder n-1 data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Leave-p-Out Cross Validation (LpO-CV)** - we assign a integer p < n and then loop over the combinatorial of possible cases with p withheld testing data. Since we consider all possible cases, this is an exhaustive cross validation approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the above folds or in general, training and testing dataset combinations, we calculate the error norm \n",
    "\n",
    "* then we average the error norm over the folds to provide a single error for hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "* this method removes the sensitivity to the exact train and test split so it is often seen as more robust than regular hold out methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of proportion of the data to withhold for testing varies by the the cross validation method,\n",
    "\n",
    "* for k-fold cross validation the proportion of testing is implicit to the choice of k, for k = 3, 33% of data are withheld for each fold and for k=5, 20% of data are withheld for each fold\n",
    "\n",
    "* for leave-one-out cross validation the proportion of testing is $\\frac{1}{n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* for leave-p-out cross validation the proportion of testing is $\\frac{p}{n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Train, Validate and Test Split\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an alternative approach with three exhaustive, mutually exclusive subsets of the data \n",
    "\n",
    "* **training data** - subset is the same as train above and is used to train the model parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* **validate data** - subset is like testing subset for the train and test split method above and is used to tune the model hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* **testing data** - subset is applied to check the final model trained on all the data with the tuned hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The train, validate and test split philosophy is that this final model check is performed with data that was not involved with model construction, including training model parameters nor tuning model hyperparameters. There are two reasons that I push back on this method,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **circular quest of perfect model validation** - what do we do if we don't quite like the performance in this testing phase, do we have a fourth subset for another test? and a fifth subset? and a sixth subset? ad infinitum?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **we must train the deployed model with all data** - we can never deploy a model that is not trained with all available data; therefore, we will still have to train with the test subset to get our final model?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **reducing modeling training and tuning performance** - the third data split for the testing phase reduces the data available for model training and tuning reducing the perforamnce of these critical steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Spatial Fair Train and Test Splits\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Julian Salazar suggested that for spatial prediction problems that random train and test split may not fair. He proposed a [fair train and test split method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410521015023) for spatial prediction models that splits the data based on the difficulty of the planned use of the model. Prediction difficulty is related to kriging variance that accounts for spatial continuity and distance offset. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "* if the model will be used to impute data with small offsets from available data then construct a train and test split with train data close to test data\n",
    "\n",
    "* if the model will be used to predict a large distance offsets then perform splits the result is large offsets between train and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this method the tuned model may vary based on the planned real-world use for the model.  \n",

    "\n",
    "* they trained a model to check for snow in the background. As a Canadian, I can assure you that many photos of wolves are in our snow filled northern regions of our country, while many dogs are photographed in grassy yards.\n",

    "The problems with machine learning are,\n",

    "* interpretability may be low with complicated models\n",
    "\n",
    "* application of machine learning may become routine and trusted\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a dangerous combination, as the machine may become a trusted unquestioned authority. Rideiro and others state that they developed the problem to demonstrate this, but does it actually happen? Yes. I advised a team of students that attempted to automatically segment urban vs. rural environments from time lapse satellite photographs to build models of urban development. The model looked great, but I asked for an additional check with a plot of the by-pixel classification vs. pixel color. The results was a 100% correspondence, i.e., the model with all of it's complicated convolution, activation, pooling was only looking for grey and tan pixels often associated with roads and buildings.  \n",
