    "#### Motivations for Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple workflow, demonstration of linear regression for machine learning-based predictions. Why start with linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear regression is the simplest parametric predictive machine learning model\n",
    "* We learn about training machine learning models with an analytical solution calculated from the derivative of training MSE\n",
    "* Get's us started with the concepts of loss functions and norms\n",
    "* We have access to analytics expressions for confidence intervals for model uncertainty, and hypothesis tests for parameter significance\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some basic details about linear regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression for prediction, let's start by looking at a linear model fit to a set of data.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by defining some terms,\n",
    "\n",
    "* **predictor feature** - an input feature for the prediction model, given we are only discussing linear regression and not multilinear regression we have only one predictor feature, $x$. On out plots (including above) the predictor feature is on the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **response feature** - the output feature for the prediction model, in this case, $y$. On our plots (including above) the response feature is on the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, here are some key aspects of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parametric Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a parametric predictive machine learning model, we accept an a prior assumption of linearity and then gain a very low parametric representation that is easy to train without a onerous amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* the fit model is a simple weighted linear additive model based on all the available features, $x_1,\\ldots,x_m$.\n",
    "* the parametric model takes the form of: \n",

    "**Least Squares**\n",
    "\n",
    "The analytical solution for the model parameters, $b_1,\\ldots,b_m,b_0$, is available for the L2 norm loss function, the errors are summed and squared known a least squares.\n",
    "* we minimize the error, residual sum of squares (RSS) over the training data: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "**Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are important assumption with our linear regression model,\n",
    "* **Error-free** - predictor variables are error free, not random variables \n",
