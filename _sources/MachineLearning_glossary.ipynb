    "#### Motivation for Machine Learning Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, why do this? I have received the request for a course glossary from the students in my **Subsurface Machine Learning** combined undergraduate and graduate course. While I usually dedicate a definition slide in the lecture slide decks for salient terms, some of my students have requested course glossary, list of terminology for their course review. The e-book provides a great vehicle and motivation to finally complete this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me begin with a confession. There is a [Machine Learning Glossary](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary) written by Google developers. For those seeking the in depth, comprehensive list of geostatistical terms please use this book!\n",
    "\n",
    "* By writing my own glossary I can limit the scope and descriptions to course content. I fear that many students would be overwhelmed by the size and mathematical notation of a standard machine learning glossary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also, by including a glossary in the e-book I can link from glossary entries to the chapters in the e-book for convenience. I will eventual populate all the chapters with hyperlinks to the glossary to enable moving back and forth between the chapters and the glossary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, like the rest of the book, I want the glossary to be a evergreen living document.\n",

    "[Machine Learning Concepts](MachineLearning_concepts): an automated (subconscious) thought process used by human brain to simplify information processing from large amount of personal experience and learned preferences. While these have been critical for our evolution and  survival on this planet, they can lead to the following issues in data science:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Anchoring Bias*, too much emphasis on the first piece of information. Studies have shown that the first piece of information could be irrelevant as we are beginning to learn about a topic, and often the earliest data in a project has the largest uncertainty. Address anchoring bias by curating all data, integrating uncertainty, fostering open discussion and debate on your project team.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Availability Heuristic*, overestimate importance of easily available information, for example, grandfather smoked 3 packs a day and lived to 100 years old, i.e., relying on anecdotes. Address availability heuristic by ensuring the project team documents all available information and applies quantitative analysis to move beyond anecdotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Bandwagon Effect*, assessed probability increases with the number of people holding the same belief. Watch out for everyone jumping on board or the loudest voice influencing all others on your project teams. Encouraging all members of the project team to contribute and even separate meetings may be helpful to address bandwagon effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Blind-spot Effect*, fail to see your own cognitive biases. This is the hardest cognitive bias of all. One possible solution is to invite arms length review of your project team's methods, results and decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Choice-supportive Bias*, probability increases after a commitment, i.e., a decision is made. For example, it was good that I bought that car supported by focusing on positive information about the car. This is a specific case of confirmation bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Clustering Illusion*, seeing patterns in random events. Yes, this heuristic helped us stay alive when large predictors hunted us, i.e., false positives are much better than false negatives! The solution is to model uncertainty confidence intervals and test all data and results against random effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. *Confirmation Bias*, only consider new information that supports current model. Choice-supportive bias is a specific case of confirmation bias. The solution to confirmation bias is to seek out people that you will likely disagree with and build skilled project teams that hold diverse technical opinions and have different expert experience. My approach is to get nervous if everyone in the room agrees with me! \n",
    "\n",
    "8. *Conservatism Bias*, favor old data to newly collected data. Data curation and quantitative analysis are helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. *Recency Bias*, favor the most recently collected data. Ensure your team documents previous data and choices to enhance team memory. Just like conservative bias, data curation and quantitative analysis are our first line of defense.\n",
